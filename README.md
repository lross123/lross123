## Featured Engineering & Research

### 1. [Sub-Microsecond Kernel-Bypass Trading Engine](LINK_TO_YOUR_REPO)
* **Stack:** C++20, DPDK, AVX-512, Intel Xeon, Linux
* **Architecture:** Designed a deterministic OPRA feed handler achieving 780ns latency. Implemented lock-free SPSC ring buffers, branchless risk gates, MESI cache-coherency optimisations, and vectorised Black-Scholes Greeks using Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) intrinsics.

### 2. [Deep Hedging: Non-Markovian Volatility](LINK_TO_YOUR_REPO)
* **Stack:** Python, JAX (XLA), PyTorch
* **Research:** Engineered a neural network-based derivatives hedging engine under the Rough Bergomi model. Utilised JAX vectorisation and stochastic calculus to optimise hedging costs across non-linear payoff structures.
